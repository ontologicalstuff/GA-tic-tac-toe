# GA-tic-tac-toe
This is project 0 for General Assembly's project 0. The game I opted for is the perennial favorite tic-tac-toe.

The game is simple to play and requires two players. The first player, whom is assigned 'X', clicks on an empty square to fill it with their assigned character. Ditto for the second player (except they're assigned 'O'). The first player to get three characters in a row wins, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If the board fills up and there are no straight rows of characters, it's a tie.
